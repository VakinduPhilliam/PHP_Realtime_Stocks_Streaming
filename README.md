Real-time Stocks Streaming with PHP and JavaScript by PubNub Network.



This software application sends real-time stocks data from a
 PHP Server Process to an HTML5 JavaScript app in real-time.


Stock Quotes are broadcast from the PHP Server 
into the PubNub Network where the HTML5 JavaScript app 
will receive quotes data and display it in real-time.


This is a brief walkthrough of how to build a Real-time Stock 
Streaming application using PHP and JavaScript, leveraging the 
PubNub Real-time Network as the
Data Channel broker.



The PHP Process can be run in parallel with other PHP processes
 which allows publishing of real-time quote data into the PubNub Cloud.


The JavaScript HTML5 App is able to receive a user-selected 
variety of symbols.



This application is based on Channel Groups, History and Access Manager features.
